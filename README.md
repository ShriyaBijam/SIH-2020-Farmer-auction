# SIH-2020-Farmer-auction
An interactive farmers website for auctioning their produce

Problem Statement 
  Lack of technological intervention in value of agriculture products produced by SHG/FPGs (Self help groups/ Farmer Producer Groups).
  PS number- MK100
  Domain bucket : Agriculture And Rural Development
  Organization: Government Of Uttarakhand

Solution
  The main problem small and marginal farmers face, is selling their produce at a substantially profitable price.
  We aim to solve this problem by developing an auction site where farmers upload their produce details and potential buyers can bid for     the products they desire.
  The site eliminates the need of middle men who take away a major share of farmersâ€™ profit.

Future Aspect
  Delivery Logistics to ensure fast deliveries and minimize the cost.
  Implementation of SMS services for farmers not having access to internet services so they too, can avail the auction services.
  Expansion of services to other varieties of agricultural products like food grains.
  Storage Facilities: Warehouses for crops.
